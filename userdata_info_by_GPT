Sure! Here are the steps you can follow to deploy a Dockerized Mongo-Flask app on your EC2 instance using a user-data file:

Launch a new EC2 instance on your AWS console and choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that supports Docker (such as Amazon Linux 2).

In the "Configure Instance Details" page, scroll down to "Advanced Details" and paste the following script in the "User data" field:

bash.
1. Replace <your_repo_url> with the URL of your Git repository where your Flask app and Dockerfile are located.

2.Replace <your_repo_folder> with the folder name of your Git repository where your Flask app and Dockerfile are located.

3.Replace <your_docker_image_name> with a name of your choice for the Docker image you will create.

4.Save the user-data file and launch the EC2 instance.

5.Once the instance is launched, SSH into the instance using your key pair and run the following command to check if the Docker container is running:

6.Copy code:
sudo docker ps
7.If the container is running, open your browser and go to http://<your_ec2_public_ip>:5000 to access your Flask app.
That's it! These commands should install Docker and other required packages on your EC2 instance, clone your Git repository, build a Docker image, and run a Docker container with your Flask app.
